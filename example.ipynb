    "   - **Client Secret:** You'll also be provided with a `client_secret` for secure communication.\n",

    "4. **Register Redirect URI:** Register a `redirect_uri` for your application. This URI is where users will be redirected after authorizing your application's access to their ORCID data. Make sure to specify these URIs in advance to prevent errors during integration. You can use your GitHub repository URL or any other URL under your control as the `redirect_uri`.\n",
